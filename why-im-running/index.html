            <h1>Why I'm Running</h1>

            <p>I have been a resident of Shenandoah County for nearly nine years; my wife and I are raising our two children here and deeply appreciate the small town values and generous spirit of our neighbors and the other residents of this county. I believe it is time for me to step forward and serve this community in order to fill a void that has emerged in our political leadership.</p>

            <p>I&lsquo;m running for Clerk of the Court because the Clerk&lsquo;s office should not be abused for petty political purposes.</p>

            <p>I&lsquo;m running for Clerk of the Court because we need to modernize the Clerk&lsquo;s office and make it much more user-friendly while protecting personal information.</p>

            <p>I&lsquo;m running because I believe the Clerk of Court should support the constitutional rights of every citizen and treat everyone with respect.</p>

            <p>Over the past few years, the Shenandoah County Clerk of Court's office has become completely politicized, and this has not benefited the people of Shenandoah County. After allowing her feuds to block needed investments in the Clerk&lsquo;s office, now the current Clerk wants to appoint her successor, just as her predecessor handed the office to her.</p>

            <p>We need to break the poisonous cycle of political infighting and elect someone who will restore the people&lsquo;s trust in the office of Clerk of the Court. If you vote for me, I will run a professional office and I will not abuse the honor and dignity of the position of Clerk of the Court with cheap and petty political games.</p>

            <p>The current Clerk has done the bare minimum to modernize the Clerk's office and provide better access to the legal and property records stored there, just to name a few. I want to modernize and enhance remote access to these records to expand their availability and reduce the need for foot traffic in the Clerk's office. I will also adopt innovations pioneered by other clerks who have made it easier for citizens to conduct business with the Clerk's office, such as pre-filing for marriage licenses, and improving the jury pool process. These improvements can be made without placing sensitive personal information at risk.</p>

            <p>Finally, and most importantly, I believe the Clerk of Court should respect and defend the constitutional rights we all share. Other candidates for Clerk of the Court have openly expressed their hostility toward marriage equality. Even if these candidates now say they will treat everyone fairly, those who visit the Clerk's office know immediately whether they are being treated with respect or if the behavior of the staff reflects their boss's prejudices.</p>

            <p>What we need in a Clerk is a supporter of constitutional rights, liberties, and equality, and I will treat all the citizens of Shenandoah County fairly, not just the ones who look like me, the ones who vote like me, or the ones that share my particular moral compass.</p>

            <p>Election day is November 3rd. If you vote for me for Clerk of the Court, I will run a professional and modern Clerk's office. Most importantly, I am a strong supporter of constitutional rights and liberties, and every visitor to the Clerk's office will be treated with the respect and dignity we all deserve. I ask for your support now and for your vote on November 3rd.</p>
